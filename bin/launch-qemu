# Construct the QEMU command line and invoke it
#
# Expects the HPSC SDK to have been activated by loading the SDK env.sh script
# into the shell.
#
# The caller is expected to pass arguments that instantiate backends for
# non-volatile memory (-drive), via command line or arg file. Note that the
# backends are required to run at all, even if non-volatile memory is not used;
# but to reduce duplication and factor, this script does not know how to create
# the non-volatile images for these backends.
#
# The caller is also expected to pass arguments that load images into memory
# (DRAM, on chip SRAM) -- this is not strictly required to run, but any useful
# run would want to load some software image into memory. This functionality
# is also kept out of this script in order to avoid parsing map files here
# (or having an unwieldy interface based on environment variables).
#
# See mkmemimg script and conf/{,qemu/}mem.ini memory parameters for creating
# memory images, and qemu-preload-mem script for interpreting cross platform
# memory map file to know which memory images to build and what to include in
# each of them.
#
# Dependencies:
#   * screen : for display of forwarded serial UART ports
#   * Python 3: with the following modules
#      - telnetlib : for communication with Qemu via QMP interface
#      - json : for QMP
